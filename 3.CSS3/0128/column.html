            The news was first announced as the couple arrived in Sydney for their inaugural foreign tour together in
            October. Speculation around another royal baby began when Meghan’s tour schedule specified that she would
            not climb over the Sydney Harbour Bridge as planned. The rumour mill went into overdrive, however, when the
            former Suits star attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank wearing a Givenchy dress
            coat, which she chose not to remove on the day. It subsequently reached fever pitch after she was
            photographed leaving Sydney airport carrying two folders in front of her stomach.After the fabulous fanfare
            of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’s seemingly endless nuptials in India, it’s undeniable: the world can’t

            Time and time again, Victoria Beckham says that she will not take on her former Posh persona and join Baby,
            Scary, Sporty and Ginger on tour with the Spice Girls. But, time and time again, the media can’t help but
            ask the popstar-turned-designer whether she has had a change of heart and might consider dusting off her
