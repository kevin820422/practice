                        <h2>Edward Enninful And Naomi Campbell Join 14 New Industry Experts On The 2019 LVMH Prize Jury</h2>
                        <p>
                            In just two weeks, the autumn/winter 2019 ready-to-wear season will officially begin in New
                            York – but if you’ve been paying attention, you know fashion week is always happening
                            somewhere. In the next couple of months alone, Vogue will cover shows in Copenhagen,
                            Stockholm, Madrid, and Tbilisi in addition to the “main” circuit. In our increasingly
                            digital world, it’s never been easier for a designer to get noticed, regardless of where
                            they are in the world. The LVMH Prize is a consistent reminder of that; the pool of talent
                            seems to become more global by the year. In 2018, for instance, executive vice president of
                            Louis Vuitton and founder of the LVMH Prize, Delphine Arnault, revealed they got a record
                            number of applications from Asia, particularly China. “The Prize is international, and so
                            is fashion,” she tells Vogue.

                        <h2>Riccardo Tisci Calls Upon 6 Photographers For His Burberry Campaign Debut</h2>
                        <p>COURTESY OF BURBERRY
                            Riccardo Tisci’s first Burberry campaign has landed with a bang, and the reinstated promise
                            that, under his leadership the house is celebrating “a new aesthetic, a new era.” The
                            overarching theme of Burberry’s bright new dawn is inclusivity, so when plotting out his
                            first campaign as chief creative officer, Tisci called on a series of collaborators to help
                            interpret the brand's heritage and his own vision.

                            “The thing that excites me the most about Burberry is how inclusive it is – it appeals to
                            everyone no matter their age, their social standing, their race, their gender,” Tisci said
                            in a statement announcing the spring/summer 2019 campaign. “I pulled together six
                            photographers, all with a very different energy, experience and point of view of the world
                            – including British masters of photography and the next generation who have something new
                            to say – to interpret this new Burberry era and the multigenerational men and women we
                            speak to, all through their own unique eyes.”</p>
