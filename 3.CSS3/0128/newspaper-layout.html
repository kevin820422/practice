                    <h2>Victoria Beckham On Why She'll Remain A Spice Girl For Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Time and time again, Victoria Beckham says that she will not take on her former Posh persona
                        and
                        join
                        Baby, Scary, Sporty and Ginger on tour with the Spice Girls. But, time and time again, the
                        media
                        can’t
                        help but ask the popstar-turned-designer whether she has had a change of heart and might
                        consider
                        dusting off her little black dresses in the name of girl power.

                    <h2>Everything We Know About Justin Bieber And Hailey Baldwin's Wedding
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        After the fabulous fanfare of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’s seemingly endless nuptials in
                        India,
                        it’s undeniable: the world can’t resist a celebrity wedding. Next to walk down the aisle are
                        Justin
                        Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, or rather Hailey Bieber, as the two young lovers are thought to have
                        wed
                        in
                        a private civil ceremony in New York in the autumn of 2018. Rumours of a larger celebration are
                        afloat,
                        with some outlets even whispering that save-the-date cards were sent and then retracted again.
                        Herewith, is everything we know about the Bieber and Bieber marriage so far.

                    <h2>When Is Meghan and Harry's Baby Due?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The news was first announced as the couple arrived in Sydney for their inaugural foreign tour
                        together
                        in October. Speculation around another royal baby began when Meghan’s tour schedule specified
                        that
                        she
                        would not climb over the Sydney Harbour Bridge as planned. The rumour mill went into overdrive,
                        however, when the former Suits star attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack
                        Brooksbank
                        wearing a Givenchy dress coat, which she chose not to remove on the day. It subsequently
                        reached
                        fever
                        pitch after she was photographed leaving Sydney airport carrying two folders in front of her
                        stomach.
